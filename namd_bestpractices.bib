                   approach is a versatile electronic-structure tool
                   that allows one to describe a variety of
                   multiconfigurational wave functions within
                   single-reference formalism. This Review provides a
                   guide to established EOM methods illustrated by
                   examples that demonstrate the types of target states
                   currently accessible by EOM. It focuses on
                   applications of EOM-CC to electronically excited and
                   open-shell species. The examples emphasize EOM's
                   advantages for selected situations often perceived as
                   multireference cases [e.g., interacting states of
                   different nature, Jahn-Teller (JT) and pseudo-JT
                   states, dense manifolds of ionized states,
                   diradicals, and triradicals]. I also discuss
                   limitations and caveats and offer practical solutions
                   to some problematic situations. The Review also
                   touches on some formal aspects of the theory and
                   important current developments.},

                   photoinduced isomerization of retinal in the visual
                   pigment rhodopsin (Rh). Here, we use a scaled quantum
                   mechanics/molecular mechanics potential that
                   reproduces the isomerization path determined with
                   multiconfigurational perturbation theory to follow
                   the excited-state evolution of bovine Rh. The
                   analysis of a 140-fs trajectory provides a
                   description of the electronic and geometrical changes
                   that prepare the system for decay to the ground
                   state. The data uncover a complex change of the
                   retinal backbone that, at ≈60-fs delay, initiates a
                   space saving “asynchronous bicycle-pedal or
                   crankshaft” motion, leading to a conical
                   intersection on a 110-fs time scale. It is shown that
                   the twisted structure achieved at decay features a
                   momentum that provides a natural route toward the
                   photoRh structure recently resolved by using

                   Using this expression, the poles of the full response
                   function are obtained by systematic improvement upon
                   the poles of the Kohn-Sham response function.

  abstract =      {First-order nonadiabatic coupling matrix elements
                   (NACMEs) are key for phenomena such as nonradiative
                   transitions and excited-state decay, yet a consistent
                   and practical first principles treatment has been
                   elusive for molecules with more than a few heavy
                   atoms. Here we present theory, implementation using
                   Gaussian basis sets, and benchmarks of first-order
                   NACMEs between ground and excited states in the
                   framework of time-dependent hybrid density functional
                   theory (TDDFT). A time-dependent response approach to
                   NACMEs which avoids explicit Computation of
                   excited-state wave functions is outlined. In contrast
                   to previous approaches, the present treatment
                   produces exact analytical derivative couplings
                   between time-dependent Kohn–Sham (TDKS)
                   determinants in a finite atom-centered basis set. As
                   in analytical gradient theory, derivative molecular
                   orbital coefficients can be eliminated, making the
                   Computational cost independent of the number of
                   nuclear degrees of freedom. Our expression reduces to
                   the exact Chernyak–Mukamel formula for first-order
                   NACMEs in the complete basis-set limit, but greatly
                   improves basis-set convergence in finite
                   atom-centered basis sets due to additional Pulay type
                   terms. The Chernyak–Mukamel formula is shown to be
                   equivalent to the Hellmann–Feynman contribution in
                   analytical gradient theory. Our formalism may be
                   implemented in TDDFT analytical excited-state
                   gradient codes with minor modifications. Tests for
                   systems with up to 147 atoms show that evaluation of
                   first-order NACMEs causes total Computation times to
                   increase by an insignificant 10\% on average. The
                   resolution-of-the-identity approximation for the
                   Coulomb energy (RI-J) reduces the Computational cost
                   by an order of magnitude for nonhybrid functionals,
                   while errors are insignificant with standard
                   auxiliary basis sets. We compare the computed NACMEs
                   to full configuration interaction (FCI) in benchmark
                   results for diatomic molecules; hybrid TDDFT and FCI
                   are found to be in agreement for regions of the
                   potential energy curve where the Kohn–Sham
                   ground-state reference is stable and the character of
                   the excitation is properly captured by the present
                   functionals. With these developments, nonadiabatic
                   molecular dynamics simulations of molecular systems
                   in the 100 atoms regime are within reach.},

  abstract =      {This Review describes how conical intersections
                   affect measured molecular spectra and simple
                   photofragmentation processes. We consider excitations
                   that result in electron ejection, that is,
                   photoionization or photodetachment, as well as
                   photoinduced H-atom elimination. Section 1 presents a
                   brief overview of the history of conical
                   intersections and their rise from an arcane
                   theoretical concept to a major paradigm in
                   nonadiabatic chemistry. In Section 2, the generic
                   properties of conical intersections are discussed, as
                   well as their characterization with modern
                   electronic-structure methods. Section 3 briefly
                   discusses Computational tools used to compute the
                   nuclear motion involving conical intersections.
                   Section 4 describes how the ideas of Sections 2 and 3
                   are combined to simulate molecular spectra impacted
                   by conical intersections. Section 5 describes
                   selected recent experimental and Computational
                   studies of photoelectron, photodetachment, and
                   photofragment spectra. Rather than providing an
                   encyclopedic bibliography of the previous and current
                   literature, we illustrate significant problems
                   currently being addressed and describe what can be
                   accomplished with current Computational techniques
                   and how these results are achieved. Section 6
                   suggests future directions in this field.},

  abstract =      {This Review discusses how ultrafast organic
                   photochemical reactions are controlled by conical
                   intersections, highlighting that decay to the
                   ground-state at multiple points of the intersection
                   space results in their multi-mode character. , Over
                   the last few decades, conical intersections (CoIns)
                   have grown from theoretical curiosities into common
                   mechanistic features of photochemical reactions,
                   whose function is to funnel electronically excited
                   molecules back to their ground state in regions where
                   the potential energy surfaces (PESs) of two
                   electronic states become degenerate. Analogous to
                   transition states in thermal chemistry, CoIns appear
                   as transient structures providing a kinetic
                   bottleneck along a reaction coordinate. However, such
                   a bottleneck is not associated with the probability
                   of crossing an energy barrier but rather with an
                   excited state decay probability along a full
                   “line” of transient structures connected by
                   non-reactive modes, the intersection space (IS). This
                   article will Review our understanding of the factors
                   controlling CoIn mediated ultrafast photochemical
                   reactions, taking a physical organic chemist approach
                   by discussing a number of case studies for small
                   organic molecules and photoactive proteins. Such
                   discussion will be carried out by first introducing
                   the “standard” one-mode model based on
                   Landau–Zener (LZ) theory to describe a reactive
                   excited state decay event intercepting, locally, a
                   single CoIn along a single direction, and then by
                   providing a modern perspective based on the effects
                   of the phase matching of multiple modes on the same
                   local event, thus redefining and expanding the
                   description of the excited state reaction coordinate.
                   The direct proportionality between the slope (or
                   velocity) along one mode and decay probability at a
                   single CoIn is a widely applied fundamental principle
                   that follows from the LZ model, yet it fails to
                   provide a complete understanding of photochemical
                   reactions whose local reaction coordinate changes
                   along the IS. We show that in these situations, in
                   particular by focussing on rhodopsin double bond
                   photoisomerization, it is mandatory to consider
                   additional molecular modes and their phase
                   relationship approaching the IS, hence providing a
                   key mechanistic principle of ultrafast photochemistry
                   based on the phase matching of those modes. We
                   anticipate that this qualitative mechanistic
                   principle should be considered in the rational design
                   of any ultrafast excited state process, impacting
                   various fields of research ranging from photobiology
                   to light-driven molecular devices.},

  abstract =      {In the Born-Oppenheimer approximation for molecular
                   dynamics as generalized by Born and Huang, nuclei
                   move on multiple potential-energy surfaces
                   corresponding to different electronic states. These
                   surfaces may intersect at a point in the nuclear
                   coordinates with the topology of a double cone. These
                   conical intersections have important consequences for
                   the dynamics. When an adiabatic electronic wave
                   function is transported around a closed loop in
                   nuclear coordinate space that encloses a conical
                   intersection point, it acquires an additional
                   geometric, or Berry, phase. The Schrödinger equation
                   for nuclear motion must be modified accordingly. A
                   conical intersection also permits efficient
                   nonadiabatic transitions between potential-energy
                   surfaces. Most examples of the geometric phase in
                   molecular dynamics have been in situations in which a
                   molecular point-group symmetry required the
                   electronic degeneracy and the consequent conical
                   intersection. Similarly, it has been commonly assumed
                   that the conical intersections facilitating
                   nonadiabatic transitions were largely symmetry
                   driven. However, conical intersections also occur in
                   the absence of any symmetry considerations. This
                   Review discusses Computational tools for finding and
                   characterizing the conical intersections in such
                   systems. Because these purely accidental
                   intersections are difficult to anticipate, they may
                   occur more frequently than previously thought and in
                   unexpected situations, making the geometric phase
                   effect and the occurrence of efficient nonadiabatic
                   transitions more commonplace phenomena.

                   role in excited-state photochemistry. Here,
                   topography is modified systematically to quantify its
                   effects on photochemical reaction rates, reactant
                   recovery, and photoproduct yield. , Despite their
                   important role in photochemistry and expected
                   presence in most polyatomic molecules, conical
                   intersections have been thoroughly characterized in a
                   comparatively small number of systems. Conical
                   intersections can confer molecular photoreactivity or
                   photostability, often with remarkable efficacy, due
                   to their unique structure: at a conical intersection,
                   the adiabatic potential energy surfaces of two or
                   more electronic states are degenerate, enabling
                   ultrafast decay from an excited state without
                   radiative emission, known as nonadiabatic transfer.
                   Furthermore, the precise conical intersection
                   topography determines fundamental properties of
                   photochemical processes, including excited-state
                   decay rate, efficacy, and molecular products that are
                   formed. However, these relationships have yet to be
                   defined comprehensively. In this article, we use an
                   adaptable Computational model to investigate a
                   variety of conical intersection topographies,
                   simulate resulting nonadiabatic dynamics, and
                   calculate key photochemical observables. We varied
                   the vibrational mode frequencies to modify conical
                   intersection topography systematically in four
                   primary classes of conical intersections and
                   quantified the resulting rate, total yield, and
                   product yield of nonadiabatic decay. The results
                   reveal that higher vibrational mode frequencies
                   reduce nonadiabatic transfer, but increase the
                   transfer rate and resulting photoproduct formation.
                   These trends can inform progress toward experimental
                   control of photochemical reactions or tuning of
                   molecules’ photochemical properties based on
                   conical intersections and their topography.},

  abstract =      {Summary This chapter provides an overview of the
                   variational multi-configurational Gaussian (vMCG)
                   approach, which belongs to the family of Gaussian
                   wave packet (GWP) methods. It is based on similar
                   grounds to the spawning and related approaches (see
                   Chapter ), but has explicit coupling between the GWP
                   quantum amplitudes. This means that it relies on
                   “quantum trajectories” followed by the centers of
                   the GWPs, rather than classical ones. By this, it is
                   to be understood that the mean positions and momenta
                   are specifically obtained from equations of motions
                   derived from a variational solution to the
                   time-dependent Schrödinger equation (TDSE), in
                   addition to the expansion coefficients, thus
                   resulting in a favorable convergence on the exact
                   solution. GWP methods are attractive ways to solve
                   the TDSE, alternative to grid-based methods such as
                   the multi-configurational time-dependent Hartree
                   (MCTDH) approach (see Chapter ). Their main advantage
                   is that they provide a way to run direct dynamics
                   with quantum nuclei, whereby the potential-energy
                   surfaces and non-adiabatic couplings are calculated
                   on-the-fly, much as in trajectory-based approaches
                   (see Chapters –). This is achieved via an interface
                   between quantum-dynamics and quantum-chemistry
                   programs. The direct dynamics variant of vMCG is
                   known as DD-vMCG. The implementation of the method
                   and its performance will be illustrated with three
                   examples: salicylaldimine to show phase-space
                   coverage and tunneling, the butatriene cation to
                   demonstrate how it works within a non-adiabatic
                   context, and formamide to exemplify direct dynamics.},

                   present developments to the DD-vMCG algorithm that
                   improve both its accuracy and efficiency. First, a
                   new, efficient parallel algorithm to control the
                   DD-vMCG database of quantum chemistry points is
                   presented along with improvements to the Shepard
                   interpolation scheme. Second, the use of symmetry in
                   describing the potential surfaces is introduced along
                   with a new phase convention in the propagation
                   diabatization. Benchmark calculations on the allene
                   radical cation including all degrees of freedom then
                   show that the new scheme is able to produce a
                   consistent non-adiabatic coupling vector field. This
                   new DD-vMCG version thus opens the route for
                   effectively and accurately treating complex chemical
                   systems using quantum dynamics simulations.}},

                   manner on the S1 and S2 πσ* states by the ab initio
                   multiple cloning (AIMC) method. AIMC treats electrons
                   with accurate electronic structure methods “on the
                   fly”{,} and nuclear dynamics with wavefunction
                   propagation via a basis set of Ehrenfest trajectory
                   guided Gaussian wavepackets. Total kinetic energy
                   release (TKER) spectra are produced{,} as well as
                   velocity map images and N–H dissociation times.
                   These are compared to results from time-resolved
                   velocity map imaging studies{,} and the AIMC method
                   is able to provide quantitative reproduction of
                   experimental data{,} including dissociation times of
                   50–80 fs. Novel insight into the dissociation
                   mechanism is then obtained{,} with the experimentally
                   obtained time constant shown to be composed of two
                   components. Firstly{,} there is a contribution in <50
                   fs from 2-EP molecules that have sufficient energy in
                   the N–H stretch coordinate to dissociate almost
                   immediately over the barrier{,} and this is followed
                   by a second slower contribution from 2-EP molecules
                   that must sample the potential energy surface before
                   finding a way around the barrier to dissociate. This
                   two component mechanism is not observed
                   experimentally due to the temporal widths of the
                   laser pulses obscuring the dynamics in the <50 fs
                   window{,} and is shown for the first time via theory.
                   Calculations are also performed on selectively
                   deuterated 2-EP{,} demonstrating that AIMC is able to
                   produce a kinetic isotope effect for the dissociation
                   time constant{,} and correctly predict a shift to
                   lower energy in the TKER spectrum. The S2 πσ* state
                   is also shown to be unstable with respect to the S1
                   πσ* state{,} with the N–H dissociation proceeding
                   along S1 when initially excited to S2. This work
                   demonstrates that the combination of state of the art
                   theory and experiments can provide unprecedented
                   novel insight into the N–H dissociation
                   mechanism{,} with the tantalising prospect of
                   providing insight into more general heteroatom
                   hydride bond dissociation.},

  abstract =      {Summary Rapid advances in ultrafast experiments have
                   contributed to the rise of trajectory-based methods
                   for describing nonadiabatic dynamics of molecular
                   systems. In the present Chapter, we review
                   theoretical methods that represent the time-dependent
                   nuclear wave packet with trajectories that evolve
                   classically on mean-field potential energy surfaces.
                   The simplest form is the Ehrenfest method, which
                   employs an ensemble of independent trajectories. We
                   also present the Multi-Configurational Ehrenfest
                   method in which Ehrenfest trajectories are used as a
                   basis to solve the time-dependent Schrödinger
                   equation. Strategies for overcoming the limitations
                   of the methods are also discussed. Finally, we
                   present applications of these simulation methods to
                   electron dynamics induced by attosecond
                   photoionisation and to nuclear dynamics probed by
                   ultrafast x-ray scattering.},

  abstract =      {The self-consistent decay-of-mixing (SCDM)
                   semiclassical trajectory method for electronically
                   nonadiabatic dynamics is improved by modifying the
                   switching probability that determines the
                   instantaneous electronic state toward which the
                   system decoheres. This method is called coherent
                   switching with decay of mixing (CSDM), and it differs
                   from the previously presented SCDM method in that the
                   electronic amplitudes controlling the switching of
                   the decoherent state are treated fully coherently in
                   the electronic equations of motion for each complete
                   passage through a strong interaction region. It is
                   tested against accurate quantum mechanical
                   calculations for 12 atom-diatom scattering test
                   cases. Also tested are the SCDM method and the
                   trajectory surface hopping method of Parlant and
                   Gislason that requires coherent passages through each
                   strong interaction region, and which we call the
                   "exact complete passage" trajectory surface hopping
                   (ECP-TSH) method. The results are compared with
                   previously presented results for the fewest switches
                   with time uncertainty and Tully's fewest switches
                   (TFS) surface hopping methods and the semiclassical
                   Ehrenfest method. We find that the CSDM method is the
                   most accurate of the semiclassical trajectory methods
                   tested. Including coherent passages improves the
                   accuracy of the SCDM method (i.e., the CSDM method is
                   more accurate than the SCDM method) but not of the
                   trajectory surface hopping method (i.e., the ECP-TSH
                   method is not more accurate on average than the TFS
                   method).},

                   time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) method, which is an
                   algorithm for propagating wavepackets. The formal
                   derivation, numerical implementation, and performance
                   of the method are detailed. As demonstrated by
                   example applications, MCTDH may perform very
                   efficiently, especially when there are many
                   (typically four to twelve, say) degrees of freedom.
                   The largest system treated with MCTDH to date is the
                   pyrazine molecule, where all 24 (!) vibrational modes
                   were accounted for. The particular representation of
                   the MCTDH wavefunction requires special techniques
                   for generating an initial wavepacket and for
                   analysing the propagated wavefunction. These
                   techniques are discussed. The full efficiency of the
                   MCTDH method is only realised if the Hamiltonian can
                   be written as a sum of products of one-dimensional
                   operators. The kinetic energy operator and many model
                   potential functions already have this required
                   structure. For other potential functions, we describe
                   an efficient algorithm for determining optimal fits
                   of product form. An alternative to the product
                   representation, the correlation discrete variable
                   representation (CDVR) method, is also briefly
                   discussed.},

  abstract =      {The MCTDH method has been used successfully to treat
                   the non-adiabatic dynamics of a number of systems.
                   These are hard problems due to the number of modes
                   that need to be included in a calculation, and the
                   strong coupling between the nuclear and electronic
                   motion at conical intersections connecting electronic
                   states in these systems. In this review, an overview
                   of the basic theory of the method is given
                   highlighting how it is able to treat larger systems
                   than other quantum dynamics methods. The vibronic
                   coupling model Hamiltonian is also described, which
                   provides a good starting point for the description of
                   these systems. Examples of calculations made and
                   systems treated are given. Finally, a development of
                   the basic MCTDH method in which some of the usual
                   time-dependent basis functions are replaced by
                   Gaussian wavepackets is outlined. This method
                   promises not only to treat larger systems, but to
                   provide a consistent quantum--semiclassical
                   framework.},

                   round a circuit C by varying parameters R in its
                   Hamiltonian Ĥ(R), will acquire a geometrical phase
                   factor exp\{iγ(C)\} in addition to the familiar
                   dynamical phase factor. An explicit general formula
                   for γ(C) is derived in terms of the spectrum and
                   eigenstates of Ĥ(R) over a surface spanning C. If C
                   lies near a degeneracy of Ĥ, γ(C) takes a simple
                   form which includes as a special case the sign change
                   of eigenfunctions of real symmetric matrices round a
                   degeneracy. As an illustration γ(C) is calculated

                   fields; although the sign reversal of spinors on
                   rotation is a special case, the effect is predicted
                   to occur for bosons as well as fermions, and a method

                   symmetrical non-linear molecule in a spatially doubly
                   degenerate electronic state which is split in first
                   order by a doubly degenerate vibrational mode. The
                   vibronic levels are classified by a quantum number,
                   which in certain cases is formally related to the
                   combined angular momentum of electronic and
                   vibrational motion, and numerical values are obtained
                   for the energies of these levels as functions of this
                   quantum number and a dimensionless parameter
                   measuring the magnitude of the electronic-vibrational
                   coupling. It is shown that the selection rules for
                   transitions from these vibronic levels to those of a
                   non-degenerate electronic state allow changes in
                   vibrational energy of any integral number of quanta,
                   as though the Jahn-Teller effect were equivalent to a
                   distortion which makes allowed vibrational
                   transitions which would otherwise be forbidden.
                   Numerical values are given for the oscillator
                   strengths of vibronic absorption or emission bands
                   involving transitions between a Jahn-Teller distorted
                   state and an electronically non-degenerate state. It
                   is found that in transitions from the latter to the
                   former the vibrational structure of the electronic
                   band exhibits two intensity maxima if the distortion
                   is large.},
